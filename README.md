# Design-Problem-
This has been bugging me for a while (Interview Q)

The Problem: 

1. Given a tree like data struture, in which there is a root node and every node can have an arbitrary number of children, design a method of parsing that structure into a text file. 

2. What would be the best way of representing this problem with a data structure

3. Given a text file, how would you then build this tree using the data structure from your answer in question 2
